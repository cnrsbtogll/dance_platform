  "description": " - This is a template for general web app, game, common application,client,tool,component development. It is based on React framework with Tailwind CSS. The template includes the basic structure of a React project, including an index.html file and a src directory with an App.tsx file.\n - Modify index.html to change web title, create new tsx files under src if needed, and rewrite src/App.tsx to meet the user's requirements. You should NOT modify src/main.tsx and src/index.css. Modify vite.config.ts only if extra config is absolutely necessary.\n - Style your elements with Tailwind CSS classes directly in the tsx files.\n - If the user's requirements do not specify a technology stack, development language, development tools, components, etc., this template will be used by default. For example, developing an XXX application, XXX client, etc. all use this template.",
